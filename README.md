# Ghana-Health-Facilities

The main goal of this project is to map all the health facilities across the regions in Ghana. We explore the geospatial dataset and answer some questions like
- Where the most common facility is
- Who owns the maximum number of facilities?
- How are the facilities spread across the regions?
- We also map the geospatial data containing all the locations of the health facilities on a map
